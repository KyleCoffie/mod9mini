Daniel Erazo provided the following feedback on your response:
Hey Kyle, you did a great job here! However, let me give you some suggestions that would have given you a 25/25:

-- You can improve your README documentation by adding a more extended description of your project, how it works and some steps to download, set up and run your project in a local machine so other developer who wants to work on your project will know exactly what to do to make it work.

-- Also, consider creating folders for each file type in your project to improve the organization, for example, a folder called "pages" for the HTML files, another called "styles" for the CSS files, another called "static" for static files like images and another called "scripts" for the JS files.
